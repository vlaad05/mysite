            <p> This is my website. I'm Vlad Variu and I'm thrilled you're here.
              I've created this site to share my interests and some facts about
              my life. If you go back to the first page, you can navigate to my
              interests tab or my town tab, where I talk about the two towns I
              have lived in for most of my life.</p>
            <p> Enjoy exploring! Here we treat your privacy and your personal
              information safe, so feel free to give us anything you want. We
              commit to a Hippocratic oath, promising to do no harm with your
              data. According to all known laws
              of aviation, there is no way a bee
              should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get
              its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies
              anyway because bees don't care
              what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
              Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!
              Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming!
              Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?
              - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?
              - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your
              father
              paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the
              graduate.
              We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very
              proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.
              - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
              - Bye! Barry, I told you,
              stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.
              - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?
              - A little. Special day, graduation. </p>
